kde4libs (4:4.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  pkg-kde-tools has been dropped from kdelibs5-dev Depends. If your packages
  need it at build time, please add it (appropriately versionned) to the
  Build-Depends of your packages.

  HTML_INSTALL_DIR path has been switched from /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML to
  /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML. If you refer to usr/share/doc/kde4/ anywhere in the
  packaging (esp. debian/*.install or debian/rules files), replace it with
  /usr/share/doc/kde/ and bump kdelibs5-dev build dependency to (>= 4:4.4.4).
  However, this version of kdelibs still looks in /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML for
  documentation so old binary packages should keep working fine.
