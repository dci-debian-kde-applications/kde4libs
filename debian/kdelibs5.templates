Description: Upgrade even if newly started KDE 4 applications will use other user settings directory (KDEHOME)?
 You are about to upgrade to the new version of the kdelibs5 package which
 introduces a major configuration change, but it seems that there are a few KDE
 4 applications running on your system at the moment. Newly started KDE 4
 applications will use ~/.kde directory to store user settings and data (also
 known as KDEHOME) by default while currently running KDE 4 applications use
 ~/.kde4.  KDE 3 applications has always used (and will continue to use)
 ~/.kde. To avoid potential setting/data loss, you should:
 .
 1) Answer "No", terminate all KDE applications and/or KDE sessions and try
 upgrading again.
 .
 2) If you answer "Yes", you should make sure that no new KDE 4 applications
 are started before you migrate your KDE 4 settings and data.  Beware, that
 clean termination of the old KDE 4 session might not be safe due to this
 reason.
 .
 Once upgrade is complete, login to KDE as usual or, if you are only using
 individual KDE 4 applications, you may use Kaboom (available in the package of
 the same name) wizard to migrate your user settings and data before starting
 any KDE 4 application.

Description: New user settings directory (KDEHOME) for KDE 4 applications.
 Once this package is upgraded, KDE 4 applications will use ~/.kde directory to
 store user settings and data (also known as KDEHOME) by default.  Currently,
 KDE 4 applications use ~/.kde4. KDE 3 applications has always used (and will
 continue to use) ~/.kde.
 .
 When upgrade is complete, it is safe to login to KDE as usual or, if you are
 only using individual KDE 4 applications, you may use Kaboom (available in the
 package of the same name) wizard to migrate your user data before starting a
 KDE 4 application.
