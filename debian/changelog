kde4libs (4:4.0.70+svn798712-1~pre5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  +++ Auto changes by Debian KDE Builder:

  * New upstream development snapshot:
    - The latest upstream commit is r798712 by porten
    - Date: Sat, 19 Apr 2008 01:18:31 -0000
  * Corrections to *.install files:
    - kdelibs5-dev.install: 7 new file(s) added;
    - kdelibs5.install: 2 new file(s) added; 1 file(s) removed;
    - kdelibs5-data.install: 8 new file(s) added; 8 file(s) removed;

  +++ Changes by Armin Berres:

  * Update and sort *.install files.

  +++ Changes by Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez

  * Add new build depends after Qt4 have updated its build depends:
    libpng-dev, libssl-dev, libsm-dev.
  * Add version to the RUNTIME_DEPS in debian/rules.

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * New version of 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff. Still
    incomplete.
  * Shrink *-dev dependency list of kdelibs5-dev to libqt4-dev (>= 4.4.0~),
    libsoprano-dev (>= 2.0.97~). Thanks to Sune Vuorela for determining this
    set from #include's of the public headers.
  * Add 18_always_set_cmake_policy.diff patch to set CMake policy settings
    regardless of KDE_FOUND value.
  * Introduce 97_cmake26_imported_link_interfaces.diff which messes up with
    upstream build system a bit with the intention to reduce excess linkage:
    - Most changes need cmake 2.6 or later. Make kdelibs5-dev depend on
      cmake 2.6.
    - Make use of LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to control which
      libraries are exported via link interface (probably needs more tweaking).
    - Do not use export_library_dependencies() to export library dependences.
      This method was the main source of excess linkage problems. Use a brand
      new install(EXPORT) instead which supports LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.
    - Due to the change above, add "EXPORT kdelibs" property for all public 
      install(TARGETS).
    - Rewrite the part of FindKDE4Install.cmake which deals with
      KDE4_*_LIBRARY and KDE4_*_LIBS setup. Since we are using cmake IMPORTED
      targets now and let cmake do a major part of dependency handling for us,
      make each KDE4_*_LIBS variable refer to the IMPORTED target of the
      respective public KDE library. KDE4_*_LIBRARY semantics were not changed
      and they still point to the result of find_library().
  * Make kdelibs shlibs "dynamic" and ensure kdebase-runtime from KDE 4.1
    series is used as runtime dependency.

kde4libs (4:4.0.68+svn794641-1) experimental; urgency=low

   * New upstream development snapshot.

   +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

   * Sort *.install files
   * Drop 16_postgresql_include_path_fix.diff - merged upstream.
   * Add 17_findservicebydesktoppath_try_realfilepath.diff to improve
     desktop file location by path on the systems where e.g. /usr is a
     symlink. Please note this patch still does not fix what I developed
     it for. So it's useless but it does not hurt. Work in progress.

kde4libs (4:4.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  
  +++ Changes by Armin Berres:

  * Don't bump shlibs version automatically on every upload. Bumping on new
    upstream versions is enough now that the libs are stable.
  * Add versioned shlibs to libphonon4.
  * Remove kde-icons-oxygen and kdebase-runtime-data from the shlibs file of
    kdelibs5. kdebase-runtime depends on them anyway.
  * Add strict dependency of kdelibs-bin on kdelibs5 and use a more obvious
    way to remove the dependency on kdebase-runtime. shlibs.local is no more
    needed now.

  +++ Changes by Matthew Rosewarne:
